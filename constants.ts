      "Initially, you should wear your Vivera retainers full-time, except when eating, drinking, or brushing your teeth. After a few months, your dentist may recommend switching to wearing them only at night. The specific duration and frequency will be determined by your dentist based on your individual needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I care for my Vivera retainers?",
    answer:
      "To care for your Vivera retainers, clean them daily using a soft toothbrush and non-abrasive toothpaste or retainer cleaner. Rinse them thoroughly with lukewarm water. Avoid exposing them to heat, which can cause warping, and store them in their case when not in use to prevent damage.",

export const fixedRetainersFaq: FaqType[] = [
  {
    question: "What is a fixed retainer and why is it used?",
    answer:
      "A fixed retainer is a thin wire bonded to the back of your teeth to keep them in place after orthodontic treatment. It is used to prevent the teeth from shifting back to their original positions, ensuring that your smile remains straight and aligned.",
  },
  
  {
    question: "How do I care for my fixed retainer?",
    answer:
      "Caring for a fixed retainer involves maintaining good oral hygiene by brushing and flossing regularly. Special floss threaders can help clean around the retainer. Avoid eating hard or sticky foods that could damage the wire, and attend regular dental check-ups to ensure the retainer stays in good condition.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long will I need to wear a fixed retainer?",
    answer:
      "The duration for wearing a fixed retainer varies, but it is typically recommended for several years or even indefinitely. Your dentist or orthodontist will provide guidance based on your specific case and the stability of your teeth.",

export const extractionFaq: FaqType[] = [
  {
    question: "When is a tooth extraction necessary?",
    answer:
      "A tooth extraction is necessary when a tooth is severely decayed or damaged beyond repair, if there is a severe infection or risk of infection, or if there is not enough room for all the teeth in the mouth, such as with impacted wisdom teeth.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should I expect during a tooth extraction procedure?",
    answer:
      "During a tooth extraction, the area around the tooth will be numbed with a local anesthetic to prevent pain. The dentist will then remove the tooth. For a simple extraction, the dentist will loosen the tooth with an elevator and remove it with forceps. For a surgical extraction, an incision may be made to access the tooth.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I care for my mouth after a tooth extraction?",
    answer:
      "After a tooth extraction, follow the dentist’s instructions carefully. This typically includes biting down on gauze to stop bleeding, avoiding strenuous activity, not smoking or drinking through a straw, and eating soft foods. Keep the extraction site clean by rinsing gently with salt water and brushing carefully around the area.",
