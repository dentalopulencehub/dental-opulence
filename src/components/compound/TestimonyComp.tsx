       "Fantastic service from start to finish. I previously had  composite bonding veneers to my front 6 teeth at another dentists, but was very unhappy with the overall look and poor finish. When I spoke to Dr Ali about correcting this work, he was really helpful, explained the process well and made me feel at ease.  Iâ€™m now really happy with the more natural composite edge bonding he has given me.",

The dental nurses and reception staff are also lovely and will continue to go to them after my treatment is done."

I really felt valued rather than being on a conveyor belt and the dentist has won so many awards! Just wanted a checkup but now decided to get my teeth sorted as I think Iâ€™ve finally found a dental practice I can trust! Definitely recommend.",

Theres even a TV on the ceiling once you go in for your treatment which is cool. Dr Abbas and his team were friendly and professional would highly recommend dental opulence to anyone you wont be disappointed! ðŸ¤­",
