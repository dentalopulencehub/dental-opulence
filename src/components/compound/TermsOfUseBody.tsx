            </p>
            <p className=' text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#2D2D2D]'>To manage our appointment system effectively and provide high-quality service, it is important that patients attend their 
              appointments as planned. Appointments can be made or rescheduled by calling our practice. If you have any queries or concerns 
               about an appointment, please call the practice to speak to our team.
            </p>
            <p className=' text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#2D2D2D]'>
              Email reminders are sent 24 hours before an appointment, and patients are requested to inform the practice of any changes to
               their contact details. Please note that email reminders are sent as a courtesy and may not be sent/received for reasons out 
               of our control (IT failure, change in email address, etc.). Therefore, failure to attend, by not receiving an email, will not
                be considered a valid exception to our policy.
            </p>  
             <p  className=' text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#2D2D2D]'>If you are unable to keep your dental appointment, please call the practice giving us as much notice as possible—at least 2 full
               working days—so that we can offer your time slot to another patient. If less notice is given without a valid reason, the appointment
                will be considered to have been broken and may incur a charge.

           <p className=' text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#2D2D2D]'>
             Failure to attend is defined as:

              <p className='ml-2 mt-1'>1. Arriving late for an appointment (2 minutes late or more).</p>
              <p className='ml-2 mt-1'>2. Not arriving for an appointment.</p>
              <p className='ml-2 mt-1'>3. Not giving enough notice of not being able to attend (Short Notice Cancellation) – we generally require 2 full working days’ notice.</p>
              <p className='ml-2 mt-1'>2. Not arriving for an appointment due to not receiving an email reminder.</p>

            <p className='mt-2 text-[16px] font-[400] text-[#2D2D2D]'>
              Patients who attend a hygienist appointment pay a reservation fee. If a hygienist appointment is cancelled by the patient at short 
              notice (less than one full working days’ notice) or missed, then this payment will be lost, and a new fee will need to be paid
               before a new appointment can be booked. If a patient fails to attend a private or plan dental appointment with the dentist, they 
               will be charged for some or all of the cost of that appointment, in proportion to the length of the appointment and any laboratory 
               fees incurred. The final decision is at the discretion of the practice owner. We reserve the right to ask for a deposit for private
                and plan appointments with our dentist, which will be forfeited in the event of failure to attend as outlined above. If more than
                 two appointments are missed, future appointments may not be offered.
